    <title>When to leave</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
    We've all gone through the exercise:

    <p>
    <i>Flight leaves at 9, so be at the gate by 8:30, leave 20 minutes to get
        through the terminal, 20 for TSA, 15 to park and take shuttle, 45 minute drive..."</i>
</p>

<p>
    Enough! Let the computer do all that backwards
    clock math for you. Decide on a finish time (24-hour format), then add (â–²) steps in between with durations and optional descriptions. When you're done, you can bookmark the permalink URL as handy template
    for your next trip (e.g. <a href="">example</a>).
</p>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
